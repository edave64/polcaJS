<h1>Procedures</h1>
<p>
    polca allows you to create your own procedures. With them, you may extract
    parts of your expressions to separate code, make things more clear and
    help you debugging.
</p>

<h2>Access procedures</h2>
<p>
    You may access every procedure that comes bundled with polca via the
    <em>get</em> procedure.
    Get takes a string as argument, which represents its name, and returns the
    procedure, if it exists.
</p>

<p>
    <code>get '+<br />
    [0] #{Procedure}</code>
</p>

<p>
    The #{Procedure} indicates, that a procedure is lying on the stack.
</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>
    To assign a name to a value, you use the <em>:</em> operator. That applies
    on procedures too.
</p>

<p>
    <code>: 'define get ':</code>
</p>

<p>
    NOTE: This example shows a lot of polca's flexibility. You take the procedure
    behind the <em>:</em> operator, and reassigns it to <em>define</em>.
    You may use <em>define</em> now in the same way as <em>:</em>.
</p>

<p>
    <code>a define 'a 'b<br />
    [0] b</code>
</p>

<h2>Define own procedures (inside polca)</h2>
<p>
    Procedures inside polca are kept inside of curly braces. The code inside
    can be every polca expression you want. The procedure will operate on the
    same stack as its surroundings and may contain unfinished statements.
</p>
<p>
    <code>{ + 1 }<br />
    [0] #{Procedure}</code>
</p>

<h3>Usage of exec</h3>
<p>
    The command <em>exec</em> will execute a given procedure on the stack. This
    will work for user defined procedures, as well as for native ones.
</p>
<p>
    <code>exec { exec get '+ 1 } 2<br />
    [0] 3</code>
</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>
    Assigned user defined procedures will work as every assigned procedure.
    You don't need to use exec.
</p>
<p>
    <code>1+ 2 : '1+ { + 1 }<br />
    [0] 3<br />
    1+ 3<br />
    [0] 4</code>
</p>

<h3>Handling between diffent notations</h3>
<p>
    A user defined procedure will remember the notation it was generated in.
    E.g Our <em>1+</em> procedure will continue to work in postfix notation: 
</p>
<p>
    postfix:<br />
    <code>2 1+<br />
    [0] 3</code>
</p>

<h2>Define own procedures (in Javascript)</h2>
<p>
    NOTE: This section is for writing extensions to polca in Javascript. It is
    not related to the daily use.
</p>
<p>
    Native Javascript procedures behave slightly different then their
    polca-internal counterparts. They are all Javascript functions stored inside
    the <code>Math</code> module. They behave exactly like they whould in normal
    Javascript programming. The abstraction between the stack on one hand and
    arguments and return values on the other is completely done by polca itself.
</p>
<p>
    js: <br />
    <code>
        Math['1+'] = function (o) {<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;return 1 + o<br />
        }
    </code><br />
    
    polca: <br />
    <code>
        1+ 3<br />
        [0] 4
    </code>
</p>
<h3>More generic example</h3>
<p>
    js: <br />
    <code>
        Math['1+'] = function (o) {<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;return Math['+'](1, o)<br />
        }
    </code><br />
    
    polca: <br />
    <code>
        1+ 3<br />
        [0] 4<br />
        1+ ratio 1 2<br />
        [0] ratio 3 2
    </code>
</p>
